<h1>Welcome, Hola</h1>

<p>I'm a developer, cybersecurity student, gamer and family man. I mostly work on React. Here more recently have been messing with python for some cybersecurity projects.
I dab with a lot of things in Tech. I've loved tech since I was young, watching my Dad work on computers. He has always made sure everybody in the house has had one. So I was always tinkinering with them. For the past few your I have been driving trucks though. One year in between I took a break and went to a coding bootcamp and fell in love coding. Though I did'nt instintly land a job as a developer, I got a job a Electronics Tester, which made me fall more in love with Tech. Currently, I'm working from home as a Tech Advisor. I also do freelancing and attending school.
